Heavily unfinished osu! client I wrote to try to learn some Rust. Beatmap loading works, but not much other than that. I abandoned this after realizing that the underlying architecture I was going for sucked. I might work on rewriting a big chunk of this later, but it's not being worked on for now and I didn't want all of this code to just be sitting around on my hard drive.
