I kept seeing [this game](https://touhou-gamejam.web.app/ja/work/umPVfrEUfmN4Rc4y/) pop up on my Twitter timeline and trying to write a program to get the highest possible score looked like fun, so I did it. It ended up taking way longer than I expected. Nevertheless, it was still a fun exercise in reverse engineering IL2CPP games and designing fast code.

The score is a bit inaccurate and there are a couple of obvious optimizations that I could've done (e.g. multithreading) but I've already spent enough time on this as-is.
