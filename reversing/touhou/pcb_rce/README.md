# Perfect Cherry Blossom Replay Decompression RCE

This exploits a heap buffer overflow in Perfect Cherry Blossom's replay decompression. Since it's a heap overflow, this probably won't work at all for anyone, so I'm completely fine with releasing this. Even though it's useless, it was still fun to make.
